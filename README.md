Basic python code to convert a .wav audio file to text
code just converts a .wav audio file to text.
This is really inconvenient, as the recorded audio files are usually m4a or mp3 files, and they have to be manually converted to .wav type, as m4a or mp3 is not supported in speech_recognizer package
I have tried to use microphone() from PyAudio, but some reason its not getting installed in my computer.
So, lets stick with this initial primitive version for now.

First load an audio file of .wav type and it will be converted to text. 
Thats it for now!
